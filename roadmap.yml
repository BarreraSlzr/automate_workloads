    milestone: Type-Safe Automation Refactor
  - task: Curate and automate roadmap.yml and project_status.yml as canonical fossils
    status: in progress
    owner: emmanuelbarrera
    context: Ensure both roadmap.yml and project_status.yml are treated as curated, versioned fossils, updated by automation, and integrated into E2E/CI workflows for traceability and reproducibility.
    subtasks:
      - task: Write a script to automate updates to roadmap.yml (like update-project-status.ts)
        status: planned
      - task: Add a README or doc comment to both files explaining their fossilization/curation role
        status: planned
      - task: Integrate both files into E2E/CI/pre-commit workflow for full automation and traceability
        status: planned
      - task: Update roadmap.yml with the new project status/general task block

        status: planned
      - task: Update onboarding docs and recommendations as needed
        status: planned
    key_points:
      - project_status.yml is generated/updated by scripts/update-project-status.ts and is a canonical, curated fossil artifact.
      - roadmap.yml should be treated the same way: a living, curated, versioned fossil, updated by automation and committed as a source of truth.
      - Both files enable traceability, automation, and reproducibility for the project.
      - Automate updates, curate and commit, integrate into E2E/CI, and document the workflow in onboarding/CONTRIBUTING docs.
