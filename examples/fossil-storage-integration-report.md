## üìù Example Entries

### Monitoring Observation
```json
{
  "type": "observation",
  "title": "Progress Monitoring - 2024-01-15",
  "content": "Health score: 85/100, Action plan completion: 75%, Automation completion: 60%",
  "tags": ["monitoring", "progress", "automation"],
  "source": "automated"
}
```

### Action Plan
```json
{
  "type": "plan",
  "title": "Action Plan: Improve Documentation",
  "content": "Priority: High, Effort: Medium, Impact: High",
  "tags": ["action-plan", "documentation", "improvement"],
  "source": "llm"
}
```

### Decision
```json
{
  "type": "decision",
  "title": "Decision: Use Context Fossil Storage",
  "content": "Rationale: Persistent knowledge base for self-improving systems",
  "tags": ["decision", "architecture", "knowledge-base"],
  "source": "llm"
}
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### In Monitoring Workflows
```bash
# Monitor progress and store in fossil storage
bun run repo:monitor emmanuelbarrera automate_workloads |   bun run context:add --type observation --source automated
```

### In Action Planning
```bash
# Generate action plan with context
CONTEXT=$(bun run context:summary --type decision --tags "architecture")
bun run repo:plan --context "$CONTEXT" |   bun run context:add --type plan --source llm
```

### In Decision Making
```bash
# Get relevant context for decision
CONTEXT=$(bun run context:query --tags "performance,technology")
# Use context in decision-making process
```

## üéâ Conclusion

The context fossil storage system creates a living, breathing knowledge base that evolves with the project. By integrating with the monitoring and tracking system, it enables:

- **Self-Documentation**: Automatic capture of decisions and insights
- **Continuous Learning**: Accumulation of knowledge over time
- **Context-Aware Automation**: Informed decision making based on history
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Persistent storage of valuable context

This creates a truly self-improving automation ecosystem that gets smarter and more effective over time.
