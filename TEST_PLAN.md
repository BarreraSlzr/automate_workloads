# ðŸ§ª Test Plan: Unit Tests & Coverage for @/examples and Main User Stories

## 1. Goals
- Ensure all example scripts and main user flows are covered by automated unit tests
- Achieve and maintain high code coverage (target: 90%+)
- Automate, document, and enforce testing at every stage
- Treat CI as the gatekeeper for quality
- Make tests a first-class citizen in the workflow

## 2. Scope
- All files in `@/examples` (integration, orchestration, fossil storage, etc.)
- Main user story cases (end-to-end flows, CLI entrypoints)
- Utility and service modules used by examples

## 3. Test Strategy
- Use Bun's built-in test runner (or Jest if needed)
- Write unit tests for all functions, classes, and CLI commands
- Add integration tests for main user flows
- Mock external dependencies (GitHub, LLM, etc.)
- Use snapshot tests for CLI outputs where appropriate

## 4. Coverage Targets
- **Statements:** 90%+
- **Branches:** 85%+
- **Functions:** 90%+
- **Lines:** 90%+

## 5. CI Integration
- Run all tests and coverage checks on every PR and push (GitHub Actions)
- Fail CI if coverage drops below target
- Require passing tests and coverage for PR merge

## 6. Reporting
- Generate coverage reports (text + HTML)
- Upload coverage artifacts to GitHub Actions
- Comment coverage summary on PRs (optional)

## 7. Ownership
- All contributors are responsible for maintaining and improving test coverage
- PRs must include or update tests for new/changed code
