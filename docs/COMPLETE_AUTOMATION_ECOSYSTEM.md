## 🧬 Fossilization Feedback Loop: Local Fossils, GitHub, and Automation

- **Local fossils** (e.g., `fossils/roadmap.yml`, `fossils/project_status.yml`, `github-fossil-collection.json`) serve as the source of truth for project state, tasks, and automation targets.
- **Automation tools** (like `automate-github-fossils` and the Repository Orchestrator) read these fossils, check for existing issues/milestones/labels both locally and on GitHub, and only create new items if they do not already exist (deduplication).
- **Fossilization percentage** is calculated as the proportion of roadmap tasks that have corresponding GitHub artifacts (issues, milestones, labels). This metric can be surfaced in CLI output or reports.
- **Recommendations** are generated for missing or incomplete fossilization, suggesting which tasks to sync next or which labels/milestones to create or clean up.
- **Feedback loop**: As GitHub state changes (e.g., issues closed, milestones completed), automation tools update local fossils to reflect the current state, ensuring traceability and reproducibility.
- **Extensibility**: The system can be extended to support new artifact types, advanced reporting, and LLM-driven insights for continuous improvement.

## Local-Only Automation
- All automation, orchestration, and integration testing is performed locally within this repository.
- There is no `remote-repo` or cross-repo simulation; all scripts and tests reference the local repository only.

## Integration Testing & Coverage
- Integration tests for all major shell scripts are required and included in `tests/integration/`.
- Integration tests are included in coverage metrics and must be maintained as part of overall test coverage.
- Pre-commit hooks run all integration tests and block commits if any fail or if coverage drops below the expected threshold.

## Script Best Practices
- **Argument Validation:** Always check that required arguments are provided and non-empty.
- **Timeouts:** Use timeouts for all external commands to prevent hangs.
- **Clean Output:** Remove debug output from production scripts for clarity and CI stability.

## Running Integration Tests
```sh
bun test tests/integration --coverage
```

## Contribution Guidelines
- All new scripts and features must include integration tests.
- Documentation and coverage must be kept up to date.

## Best Practices for Automation Scripts (June 2025)

### Idempotency
- Automation should be safe to run multiple times without causing duplicate resources or clutter.
- Always check for the existence of resources (like issues, PRs, labels) before creating them.

### Accurate State Management
- Use robust CLI commands (e.g., `gh issue list --json number`) to get accurate repository state.
- Avoid relying on paginated or partial API responses unless you aggregate all pages.
- Keep health diagnostics and repository state clearly separated in your outputs and logic.

### Error Handling
- Handle each check or action independently, providing clear and actionable error messages.
- Avoid broad error handling that can obscure the source of problems.

### Continuous Verification
- Test automation for idempotency and correctness by running it repeatedly and in different repo states.
- Document and review learnings after each major improvement or bugfix.

### Issue Labeling and Organization
- All issues created by automation must have at least one label (default: `automation`).
- If a required label does not exist, it should be created automatically.
- Any existing open issues without labels should be automatically labeled with the default label.
- This ensures consistent organization and makes it easy to filter/search automation-related issues.

## Fossil-Backed Issue Creation: Best Practice

All new GitHub issues must be created using the fossil-backed utility or CLI. This ensures deduplication, traceability, and context preservation for every issue.

### CLI Example
```sh
bun run src/cli/create-fossil-issue.ts \
  --owner barreraslzr \
  --repo automate_workloads \
  --title "My Issue Title" \
  --body "My issue body" \
  --labels "automation,bug" \
  --milestone "Sprint 1"
```

### TypeScript Example
```typescript
import { createFossilIssue } from '../src/utils/fossilIssue';
const result = await createFossilIssue({
  owner: 'barreraslzr',
  repo: 'automate_workloads',
  title: 'My Issue Title',
  body: 'My issue body',
  labels: ['automation', 'bug'],
  milestone: 'Sprint 1',
});
```

> **Warning:** Do NOT use direct `gh issue create` or `GitHubService.createIssue` for new issues. These are deprecated in favor of fossil-backed creation.

## Fossilization & Excerpts

Every fossil entry now includes an LLM-generated `excerpt` field. This excerpt is a one-sentence summary generated using the fossil's type, title, tags, metadata, and content, providing a quick, human-readable preview for audits and reports.

- Excerpts are generated at creation time using an LLM (OpenAI or compatible)
- If LLM is unavailable, a fallback (first 80 chars of content) is used
- Excerpts are visible in all summary, list, and reporting tools

## Auditability & Reporting

- Use the `context-fossil list` command or the summary scripts to quickly audit the state of your repo
- Cleanup scripts ensure only production fossils remain 

## 🦴 LLM-Powered Migration & Issue Update

- The ecosystem now supports automated migration and updating of issues to a modern, structured format using LLMs (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set) or robust local extraction.
- All issues and fossils use a canonical markdown + JSON block format for traceability and automation.
- The migration script (`scripts/migrations/003-migrate-legacy-issues.ts`) can update single issues or batch migrate all open issues.

### LLM Integration for Metadata Extraction
- When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, the system uses OpenAI to extract purpose, checklist, and metadata from legacy markdown issues.
- If LLM is unavailable, robust local extraction ensures all checklists and metadata are captured. 

## Fossil-First Test Output Policy

All test and script output files must serve a clear purpose for fossil curation, automation, or traceability. This means:
- Only write output files if they are curated as fossils or referenced in `fossils/roadmap.yml`, `fossils/project_status.yml`, or onboarding documentation.
- Do **not** write temporary or test output files unless they are used for fossilization, context gathering, or are part of the automation/reporting workflow.
- Remove or refactor any test or script that writes files not used for these purposes.
- Register all curated fossil outputs in the `fossils/` directory and reference them in the roadmap or project status as appropriate.

This policy ensures a clean, meaningful fossil set and maximizes the value of all automation artifacts for future context gathering and reproducibility. 

## 🏠 Local LLM Integration & Extensibility

The automation ecosystem now supports pluggable local LLM backends, with Ollama as the default. You can register additional backends (e.g., llama.cpp, vLLM) for local inference and cost optimization.

### Features
- Ollama-first, but extensible to any local LLM backend
- Intelligent routing between cloud and local LLMs
- CLI option to select/switch local backend
- Type-safe backend registration in code

### CLI Usage Example
```sh
bun run src/cli/llm-usage.ts --local-backend ollama
bun run src/cli/llm-usage.ts --local-backend llama.cpp
```

### Extending in Code
```typescript
import { LLMService } from '../src/services/llm';
const llmService = new LLMService({ enableLocalLLM: true });
llmService.registerLocalBackend('llama.cpp', async (options) => {
  // Call llama.cpp binary or API
  return { choices: [{ message: { content: '[llama.cpp] response' } }] };
});
```

## 🦴 LLM Fossilization: Insights, Benchmarks, Discoveries

All LLM outputs (insights, benchmarks, model discoveries) can be fossilized for traceability, reproducibility, and retrospective analysis.

- **Types:** See `src/types/llmFossil.ts` for `LLMInsightFossil`, `LLMBenchmarkFossil`, `LLMDiscoveryFossil`.
- **Utility:** Use `src/utils/fossilize.ts` to store fossils in `fossils/llm_insights/`.
- **Integration tests:** See `tests/integration/llm-fossilization.integration.test.ts`.

### Example: Fossilizing an LLM Insight
```typescript
import { fossilizeLLMInsight } from '../src/utils/fossilize';
import { LLMInsightFossil } from '../src/types/llmFossil';

const fossil: LLMInsightFossil = {
  type: 'insight',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  model: 'gpt-4',
  provider: 'openai',
  excerpt: 'Test insight',
  prompt: 'What is AI?',
  response: 'AI is ...',
};
await fossilizeLLMInsight(fossil);
```

### Example: CLI/Automation
- All fossils are stored in `fossils/llm_insights/` for audit and reporting.
- Use the provided utilities to fossilize benchmarks and discoveries as well. 

## 🧠 Intelligent LLM Routing

The automation ecosystem supports intelligent routing between local and cloud LLMs. You can control routing with CLI flags:

- `--prefer-local`: Always use local LLM (if available)
- `--prefer-cloud`: Always use cloud LLM
- `--auto`: Use intelligent routing (default)

**Examples:**
```sh
bun run src/cli/llm-usage.ts --prefer-local
bun run src/cli/llm-usage.ts --prefer-cloud
bun run src/cli/llm-usage.ts --auto
```

You can also select the local backend:
```sh
bun run src/cli/llm-usage.ts --local-backend llama.cpp --prefer-local
```

In code:
```typescript
import { LLMService } from '../src/services/llm';
const llmService = new LLMService();
llmService.setRoutingPreference('auto'); // or 'local', 'cloud'
const result = await llmService.callLLM({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  apiKey: '...',
  messages: [...],
  routingPreference: 'local', // override per-call
});
```
