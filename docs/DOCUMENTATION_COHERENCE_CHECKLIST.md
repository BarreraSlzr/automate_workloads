# ðŸ“‹ Documentation Coherence Checklist
_Last updated: 2024-07-04_

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Maintain consistency across all documentation by validating that:
- All docs promote the same patterns and best practices
- Examples are consistent and up-to-date
- Deprecated patterns are clearly marked
- New features are properly documented
- Cross-references are accurate and helpful

## âœ… Completed

- [x] **2025-07 Major Refactor:** All deprecated patterns (execSync, JSON.parse, gh issue create, etc.) are now removed from code and documentation. All examples and references use canonical utilities and patterns. The validator enforces this project-wide.
- [x] **Fossil-backed creation promotion** (API_REFERENCE.md, CLI_COMMAND_INSIGHTS.md, etc.)
- [x] **Centralized CLI patterns** (GitHubCLICommands, no direct execSync)
- [x] **Validation patterns** (Zod, params object)
- [x] **Canonical fossilization of roadmap.yml and project_status.yml**
- [x] **Test output policy** (tests only write curated fossils)
- [x] **Local LLM integration** (Ollama, fallback, routing)
- [x] **Fossil publication workflow** (YAML â†’ JSON â†’ Markdown, public API)
- [x] **Error handling** (service response pattern, CLI error handling)
- [x] **Cross-reference validation** (all links and code references valid)
- [x] **Content consistency** (terminology and examples up-to-date)
- [x] **Feature documentation** (new features documented, deprecated marked)
- [x] **Maintenance tasks** (regular reviews, validation, cleanup)
- [x] **Supervised LLM calls in CI/CD are documented and controlled**
  - GitHub-authenticated operations (repo:orchestration) are allowed
  - External LLM calls require supervision and approval
  - Valuable CI/CD use cases are identified and documented
  - Rate limiting and cost monitoring are implemented
  - Future valuable scopes are explored and documented
- [x] **Visual documentation standards** (Mermaid diagrams, issue bodies, fossil publications)
  - Comprehensive visual standards guide created
  - Mermaid usage patterns established across documentation
  - Issue body templates enhanced with visual elements
  - Fossil publication workflow includes visual generation
  - Audience-specific visual templates (technical, management, stakeholder)
  - Visual diagram generation utilities implemented

## â¬œ To Do

- [ ] **Automate fossil-to-markdown/json workflow with GitHub Actions/CI**
- [ ] **Integrate LLM Insights for completed tasks**
- [ ] **Advanced automation/workflow scheduling**
- [ ] **Enhanced fossil management/versioning system**
- [ ] **Close remaining documentation gaps (if any)**
- [ ] **Extend visual standards to additional outputs**
  - CLI output enhancement with diagrams
  - Automated visual analysis of content
  - Visual analytics dashboard
  - Performance optimization for diagram generation

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

### For Contributors
1. Run this checklist before submitting documentation changes
