# Fix Context Fossil Duplication with Better Structure/Versioning/Tags

## Problem

Context fossils are duplicating with identical content but different timestamps and IDs. This creates unnecessary storage overhead and makes fossil management difficult.

## Current Issues

- Multiple fossils with identical content: `Health Score: 65/100\nOpen Issues: 0\nAutomation Opportunities: 1\nActive Workflows: 0\nRecommendations: Add a comprehensive README.md file`
- No content-based deduplication mechanism
- Timestamp-based IDs don't prevent content duplication
- No versioning system for similar observations

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Content-Based Deduplication
- Implement content hash-based fossil IDs
- Check for existing fossils with same content before creating new ones
- Update existing fossils instead of creating duplicates

### 2. Enhanced Versioning System
- Add semantic versioning for fossil content changes
- Implement fossil update/merge logic
- Track content evolution over time

### 3. Improved Tagging Structure
- Add content-specific tags (e.g., `content-hash:abc123`)
- Implement tag-based grouping and filtering
- Add metadata for duplicate detection

### 4. Fossil Management
- Add fossil cleanup/consolidation utilities
- Implement fossil lifecycle management
- Add duplicate detection and merging tools

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Implement content hash-based IDs
2. **Phase 2**: Add versioning and update logic
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance tagging system
4. **Phase 4**: Create management utilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No duplicate fossils with identical content
- [ ] Content hash-based fossil identification
- [ ] Fossil versioning system
- [ ] Duplicate detection and merging
- [ ] Fossil cleanup utilities
- [ ] Updated fossilization documentation
