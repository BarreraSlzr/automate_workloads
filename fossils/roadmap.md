# E2E Automation & Testing Roadmap
_Source: e2e-pre-commit | Created: [object Object]_

- [x] **Project Setup, Onboarding, and Audit Readiness**

- [x] **Update integration tests to use real repo**

- [x] **Document fossilization workflow**

- [x] **Automate roadmap to GitHub issue/project sync**

- [ ] **Prototype Gist-based fossilization for account-level fossils**

- [x] **Tag all test-created issues/labels for cleanup**
  - Recommendation: Use unique tags/labels
  - Preference: Automate cleanup

- [x] **Add reporting/cleanup scripts for test artifacts**
  - Recommendation: Run post-test in CI
  - Preference: Summarize repo changes

- [ ] **Set up script to automatically curate test outputs as fossils**
  - Recommendation: Automate curation post-test; only write files that are curated fossils or referenced artifacts
  - Preference: Store curated outputs in fossils/ or a dedicated directory

- [x] **Integrate E2E tests into CI pipeline**
  - Recommendation: Fail fast on setup/auth errors
  - Preference: Run on PRs to main/test

- [x] **Save this roadmap as a fossil or issue for LLM/human reference**
  - Recommendation: Use e2e-roadmap tag/type
  - Preference: Store in /src/types or as .md/.json

- [x] **Document all E2E insights, code preferences, and automation patterns**
  - Recommendation: Add to project docs and reference in fossil
  - Preference: Keep docs up to date with codebase changes

- [ ] **Enforce schema-driven Params and runtime validation in all utilities**

- [x] **Audit and enforce schema-driven, object params pattern in all utilities**

- [x] **Canonical fossilization of roadmap.yml and project_status.yml**

- [ ] **Scaffold E2E tests for fossilization and LLM insights workflow**

- [ ] **Handle OpenAI API rate limit errors (429) in all LLM utilities**

- [ ] **Refactor test to only write curated fossil outputs**
  - Recommendation: Use as a template for refactoring other tests
  - Preference: All test outputs must be curated fossils or referenced artifacts

- [ ] **Enhance local LLM support for automation ecosystem**
  - Recommendation: Prioritize intelligent routing and fossilization integration first, then add CLI tools and optimization features. Focus on reliability and seamless fallback to cloud LLM when local LLM is insufficient.

  - Preference: Prefer local LLM for cost-sensitive automation tasks, with cloud LLM for complex analysis and generation tasks. Implement comprehensive monitoring and automatic provider switching based on performance and cost metrics.


- [ ] **Remove semantic tag test LLM patching/simulation once local Ollama model is connected**

- [ ] **Enforce Canonical Fossil Artifact Policy and Curation Workflow**

- [ ] **Automate public markdown and JSON generation from project_status.yml**

- [ ] **Automate fossil-to-markdown/json workflow with GitHub Actions/CI**

- [ ] **Fossilize prompts/system messages and publish as needed**

- [ ] **Integrate local LLM for context gathering and fossilization**

- [ ] **Close Documentation Gaps and Improve Coherence Across All Docs**
  - Recommendation: Prioritize updating API_REFERENCE.md and DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md first as they are the primary onboarding documents.
Then update specialized docs (CLI_COMMAND_INSIGHTS.md, COMPLETE_AUTOMATION_ECOSYSTEM.md) to ensure consistency.
Finally, create validation processes to maintain coherence going forward.

  - Preference: Prefer comprehensive examples and clear migration paths over theoretical documentation.
Focus on practical patterns that developers can immediately apply.
Ensure all docs reference the same patterns and examples for consistency.


- [ ] **Complete Remaining Documentation Improvements and Validation**

- [ ] **Enhanced Fossil Management and Versioning System**
  - Recommendation: Implement versioning first as it's foundational for other features.
Then add search/filtering for discovery capabilities.
Finally implement export/import for integration and backup.

  - Preference: Prefer incremental versioning with minimal storage overhead.
Focus on search performance and relevance ranking.
Ensure export/import maintains fossil integrity and relationships.


- [ ] **Advanced Automation and Workflow Scheduling**
  - Recommendation: Implement scheduled workflows first as they're most commonly needed.
Then add conditional triggers for event-driven scenarios.
Finally implement analytics for optimization and monitoring.

  - Preference: Prefer simple cron expressions for scheduling.
Focus on reliable trigger evaluation and execution.
Ensure analytics provide actionable insights.


- [ ] **Enhanced User Experience and Developer Tools**
  - Recommendation: Implement interactive tutorials first to improve onboarding.
Then create VSCode extension for editor integration.
Finally add developer templates and debugging tools.

  - Preference: Prefer simple, guided tutorials over complex documentation.
Focus on editor integration and developer productivity.
Ensure tools provide immediate value and feedback.


- [ ] **Integrate LLM Insights for Completed Tasks**

- [ ] **Embrace Event Loop Pattern for Roadmap Automation**
  - Recommendation: Use the event loop pattern for all future roadmap planning and automation. Regularly review completed events to trigger new ones and keep the roadmap evolving.


- [ ] **Explore Future Valuable LLM Automation Scopes (Event Loop Process)**
  - Recommendation: Start with Automated Testing (Event Loop #1) as it provides immediate value and validates the event loop pattern.
Then proceed with Security Automation (Event Loop #2) for critical production value.
Implement Event Loop Orchestration early to manage the growing automation ecosystem.

  - Preference: Prefer incremental event execution with clear completion criteria.
Focus on events that provide immediate value and validate the pattern.
Ensure all events integrate with existing fossilization workflows.


- [x] **Create Fast-Runnable LLM Chat Context Script**

- [ ] **Complete LLM Insight Generation and Management System**
  - Recommendation: Prioritize external review integration first as it provides immediate value for team collaboration. Then enhance task matching algorithms for better insight correlation. Finally implement sophisticated scope analysis for improved organization.

  - Preference: Prefer incremental implementation with clear validation at each step. Focus on features that provide immediate value and improve existing workflows. Ensure all enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing fossil system.


- [ ] **Implement Footprint-Batch Integration Approach**
  - Recommendation: Start with the enhanced batch commit orchestrator as it provides immediate value and validates the approach. Then implement LLM-enhanced intelligence for better strategy generation. Finally add predictive optimization and fossil-backed intelligence for continuous improvement.

  - Preference: Prefer incremental implementation with clear validation at each step. Focus on features that provide immediate value and improve existing batch commit workflows. Ensure all enhancements integrate seamlessly with the existing fossil system and footprint infrastructure.
