# ============================================================================
# BASEMENT STABILIZATION PLAN - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
# ============================================================================
#
# This plan addresses the immediate "basement" issues we created by mixing
# the project's art state with incorrect approaches. Focus is on rapid
# stabilization and restoration of the working state.
#
# CURRENT CRISIS (2025-01-07):
# - 25 commits ahead of origin/master with 200+ staged files
# - Massive fossil bloat from automated processes
# - Complex validation system that's failing
# - Git state instability from problematic operations
# - Mixed approaches creating confusion and scope creep

# NOTES
notes: |
  This basement stabilization plan addresses the immediate crisis we created
  by mixing approaches and creating complexity. The focus is on rapid
  stabilization and restoration of a working development environment.
  
  Key principles:
  - Stabilize first, enhance later
  - Maintain data safety throughout
  - Validate each step before proceeding
  - Document everything for future reference
  - Keep the art state vision alive but separate from crisis resolution
  
  This plan should be executed methodically and carefully to avoid
  further destabilization while restoring the project's working state.
