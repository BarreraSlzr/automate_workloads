  **SIMPLIFIED UNIFIED ML PROCESS (2024-07-07)**
  Consolidated and simplified the bloated management processes into core working patterns.
  
  **Key Simplifications:**
  - Removed redundant validation frameworks and anti-pattern detection systems
  - Consolidated overlapping pattern definitions into single canonical source
  - Simplified ML process orchestration to focus on what actually works
  - Replaced .txt files with enriched extensions for better ML consumption
  - Streamlined analyzeTaskStatus() integration for simpler task monitoring
  
  **Core Working Patterns:**
  - ML-ready snapshots with enriched extensions (.json/.yml over .txt)
  - Simplified batch commit orchestration
  - Streamlined pre-commit validation
  - Consolidated fossil management without complex anti-pattern systems

  - **Ephemeral Pattern Audit Utility Added (2025-07-07):**
    Introduced a DX transversal utility to audit and refactor all temp/original/backup files/scripts to follow the ephemeral pattern. This ensures clarity, prevents bloat, and supports automation. All contributors are encouraged to use this utility before committing or pushing changes. See docs/ephemeral/address/ephemeral_context_management.md for details.

# SIMPLIFIED CORE PATTERNS
simplified_core_patterns:
  - name: ML-Ready Snapshot with Enriched Extensions
    pattern: "<domain>.<context>.<type>.<ext>"
    examples:
      - "test.output.validation.json"
      - "validation.output.results.json"
      - "llm.context.unified.chat.yml"
    description: |
      Use enriched extensions that leverage expected uses as valuable snapshots
      of context, spotting data/structure/synthesis over token usage.
    validation: "All .txt files replaced with structured .json/.yml"
    compliance: "✅ Enriched extensions implemented"
  
  - name: Simplified Batch Commit Orchestration
    pattern: "batch.plan.<operation>.<status>.yml"
    example: "batch.plan.commit.ready.yml"
    description: |
      Streamlined batch operations without complex validation frameworks.
      Focus on what actually works: pre-commit → batch plan → execute.
    validation: "Batch operations complete successfully"
    compliance: "✅ Simplified orchestration working"
  
  - name: Streamlined Pre-Commit Validation
    pattern: "test.pre_commit.<validation_type>.<status>.json"
    example: "test.pre_commit.validation.pass.json"
    description: |
      Simplified validation without complex anti-pattern detection.
      Focus on core validation: TypeScript, schemas, tests.
    validation: "100% pre-commit validation pass rate"
    compliance: "✅ Streamlined validation working"
  
  - name: Consolidated Fossil Management
    pattern: "fossils/<category>/<name>.<ext>"
    example: "fossils/context/canonical_context.yml"
    description: |
      Single canonical source for each fossil type without complex
      promotion/deprecation workflows or anti-pattern detection.
    validation: "All fossils follow canonical naming"
    compliance: "✅ Consolidated management working"
  
  - name: Ephemeral Pattern Audit Utility
    pattern: "scripts/audit-ephemeral-pattern.ts"
    examples:
      - "scripts/audit-ephemeral-pattern.ts"
    description: |
      Use the audit/refactor utility to detect and refactor all temp/original/backup files/scripts to the ephemeral pattern. Integrate as a DX transversal utility for project-wide consistency.
    validation: "All temp/original/backup files follow ephemeral pattern"
    compliance: "✅ Audit utility integrated and used by contributors"

# SIMPLIFIED ML PROCESS INTEGRATION
simplified_ml_integration:
  analyzeTaskStatus_integration:
    description: |
      Simplified integration with analyzeTaskStatus() function for task monitoring.
      Focus on core metrics: success rate, duration, status without complex analysis.
    pattern: "ml.task.<script>.<metric>.json"
    example: "ml.task.automated_monitoring.success_rate.json"
    validation: "Task monitoring provides actionable insights"
    compliance: "✅ Simplified task monitoring working"
  
  snapshot_promotion:
    description: |
      Simplified promotion from testMonitoringData to canonical fossils.
      No complex anti-pattern detection, just structured data promotion.
    pattern: "fossils/monitoring/<metric>.<timestamp>.json"
    example: "fossils/monitoring/test_monitoring_data.json"
    validation: "Snapshots promoted successfully"
    compliance: "✅ Simplified promotion working"

# ENRICHED EXTENSIONS RULE
enriched_extensions_rule:
  description: |
    **NEW RULE: Avoid .txt files, promote enriched extensions that leverage extended expected uses as valuable snapshots of context that spot data/structure/synthesis over token usage.**
  
  replacements:
    - from: "test-output.txt"
      to: "test.output.validation.json"
      reason: "Structured validation results with metadata"
    
    - from: "validation-output.txt"
      to: "validation.output.results.json"
      reason: "Structured results with context and metrics"
    
    - from: "validate-unified-output.txt"
      to: "validation.unified.results.json"
      reason: "Structured unified validation with traceability"
    
    - from: "health-score-*.txt"
      to: "health.score.<timestamp>.json"
      reason: "Structured health metrics with context"
    
    - from: "recommendations-*.txt"
      to: "recommendations.<timestamp>.json"
      reason: "Structured recommendations with metadata"
  
  benefits:
    - "Better ML/LLM consumption with structured data"
    - "Rich metadata and context preservation"
    - "Easier programmatic access and analysis"
    - "Consistent with project-wide patterns"
    - "Reduced token usage through structured synthesis"
