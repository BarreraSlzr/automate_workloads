  - task: Set up script to automatically curate test outputs as fossils
    status: in progress
    owner: emmanuelbarrera
    context: >
      Create a script that scans for test-generated output files (especially .temp-fossil-content-*.json,
      .temp-issue-body-*.md, fossils/curated_roadmap_demo_*.json) and curates them as versioned fossils. Prioritize
      handling these specific patterns first, as they are the most common untracked outputs after running tests. Only
      files with a valuable fossil curation or automation use case (referenced in roadmap.yml, project_status.yml, or
      onboarding/docs) should be written by tests/scripts. All other temp/test output files should be removed or
      refactored to avoid unnecessary file creation. This will enable future context gathering, automation, and
      traceability of test artifacts. The script should be integrated into the test or CI workflow and optionally
      summarize curated outputs. **New requirements:** - The curation logic must refuse or clean up any output files
      with timestamped filenames, unless explicitly archived outside the main repo. - Only stable, canonical filenames
      are allowed for curated fossils. - Document this policy and update onboarding/CONTRIBUTING docs to reflect the new
      filename and curation rules.

  - task: Refactor test to only write curated fossil outputs
    status: planned
    owner: emmanuelbarrera
    context: >
      Refactor a specific test (e.g., one that writes .temp-fossil-content-*.json or .temp-issue-body-*.md) so that it
      only writes output files if they are curated fossils or referenced artifacts. This will serve as an example for
      enforcing the new fossil-first test output policy. **New requirements:** - Tests must never write timestamped or
      mock/demo files to the repo. - Only stable, canonical filenames are allowed for any output that is fossilized or
      versioned.

    key_points:
      - Current implementation has basic Ollama support but needs enhancement for production automation
      - Focus on intelligent routing, cost optimization, and seamless integration with existing workflows
      - Local LLM should handle most automation tasks with cloud LLM as fallback for complex operations
      - Performance monitoring and automatic optimization are critical for automation reliability
      - Comprehensive testing and documentation ensure maintainability and adoption
    recommendation: >
      Prioritize intelligent routing and fossilization integration first, then add CLI tools and optimization features.
      Focus on reliability and seamless fallback to cloud LLM when local LLM is insufficient.
    preference: >
      Prefer local LLM for cost-sensitive automation tasks, with cloud LLM for complex analysis and generation tasks.
      Implement comprehensive monitoring and automatic provider switching based on performance and cost metrics.

    tags:
      - immediate-actions
    status: planned
    owner: emmanuelbarrera
    context: >
      Implement and enforce a clear, canonical policy for fossil artifact storage, curation, and test output management.
      This ensures all fossil artifacts are versioned, traceable, and automation-friendly, and that test outputs do not
      pollute the repo with non-canonical files. The policy will clarify the use of .context-fossil/entries for
      knowledge/context fossils, and fossils/ for canonical YAML/JSON artifacts. The curation script will be updated to
      reflect this policy, and documentation and CI will be enhanced to enforce it.

      **New requirements:**

      - Timestamped filenames (e.g., file-2024-07-01T12:00:00.000Z.json) are strictly prohibited for all canonical
      fossils, exports, backups, and reports. Use stable, predictable names (e.g., project_status.yml, insight.json,
      progress-report.md).

      - Only real, curated artifacts are versioned and committed. Test/demo outputs must be cleaned up post-test and
      never committed.

      - Temporary/backup files (if needed) must be .gitignore'd or stored outside the main repo.

      - All fossil entries must have a type field and be schema-validated.

      Address critical gaps identified in documentation analysis to ensure all docs are cohesive, coherent, and aligned
      with current implementation patterns. This task consolidates all documentation improvements needed to close gaps
      between documented patterns and actual implementation, ensuring consistency across all onboarding, API, and
      development guides.





      **Critical Gaps Identified:**

      1. **Fossil-Backed Creation**: Docs mention deprecated patterns but don't clearly promote fossil-backed utilities

      2. **Intelligent Tagging**: Missing documentation of semantic tagging system and LLM integration

      3. **Centralized CLI Commands**: Inconsistent documentation of GitHubCLICommands utility

      4. **Validation Patterns**: Incomplete documentation of Zod validation and Params object patterns

      5. **Local LLM Integration**: Missing comprehensive local LLM setup and usage documentation

      6. **Fossil Publication Workflow**: Incomplete documentation of YAML→JSON→Markdown workflow

      7. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent documentation of error handling patterns

      8. **Testing Patterns**: Missing documentation of fossil-first test output policy


      **Immediate Actions Completed:**

      ✅ **GitHubService.createIssue() Fixed** - Restored functionality while maintaining backward compatibility

      ✅ **Direct execSync Calls Eliminated** - All GitHub CLI calls now use centralized `GitHubCLICommands`

      ✅ **Async/Await Patterns Standardized** - Fixed all async/await inconsistencies across codebase

      ✅ **GitHubCLICommands Enhanced** - Added API call support and improved error handling

      ✅ **Documentation Updated** - Key docs updated to promote fossil-backed creation and consistent patterns

    key_points:
      - All documentation must promote fossil-backed creation as the primary pattern
      - Intelligent tagging and LLM integration must be comprehensively documented
      - Centralized CLI patterns must be consistently referenced
      - Validation patterns must be clearly documented with examples
      - Local LLM integration must be fully documented with setup guides
      - Fossil publication workflow must be complete and future-proof
      - Error handling must be standardized across all docs
      - Test output policy must be clearly documented and enforced
    recommendation: |
      Prioritize updating API_REFERENCE.md and DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md first as they are the primary onboarding documents.
      Then update specialized docs (CLI_COMMAND_INSIGHTS.md, COMPLETE_AUTOMATION_ECOSYSTEM.md) to ensure consistency.
      Finally, create validation processes to maintain coherence going forward.
    preference: |
      Prefer comprehensive examples and clear migration paths over theoretical documentation.
      Focus on practical patterns that developers can immediately apply.
      Ensure all docs reference the same patterns and examples for consistency.

    key_points:
      - Each scope follows the event loop pattern: research → prototype → integrate → document → trigger
      - Completed events trigger new roadmap tasks, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem
      - All events integrate with existing fossilization and automation workflows
      - Event loop orchestration manages execution order and dependencies
      - Performance monitoring tracks event execution and optimization opportunities
    recommendation: |
      Start with Automated Testing (Event Loop #1) as it provides immediate value and validates the event loop pattern.
      Then proceed with Security Automation (Event Loop #2) for critical production value.
      Implement Event Loop Orchestration early to manage the growing automation ecosystem.
    preference: |
      Prefer incremental event execution with clear completion criteria.
      Focus on events that provide immediate value and validate the pattern.
      Ensure all events integrate with existing fossilization workflows.
