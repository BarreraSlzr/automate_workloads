- ✅ **Kept**: `"footprint:evolving": "bun run scripts/generate-evolving-footprint.ts"`
- ✅ **Kept**: `"footprint:validate": "bun run scripts/validate-footprint.ts"`

### 3. Updated Main Documentation

#### README.md

- ✅ Added pre-commit and footprint scripts to automation actions reference
- ✅ Updated to reflect unified approach

#### CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE.md
- ✅ Added comprehensive "Pre-commit Workflow" section
- ✅ Updated integration testing section to mention unified validation
- ✅ Added troubleshooting guide for pre-commit issues
- ✅ Documented legacy script removal

#### docs/README.md
- ✅ Updated pre-commit expectations section
- ✅ Replaced old integration test references with unified validation

### 4. Updated Documentation Files

#### Footprint-Related Documentation
- ✅ **docs/FOOTPRINT_USAGE_SCOPES.md**: Updated pre-commit hook examples
- ✅ **docs/FOOTPRINT_SIMPLIFICATION_ANALYSIS.md**: Updated script references and marked completed tasks
- ✅ **docs/FILE_FOOTPRINT_SYSTEM.md**: Updated pre-commit hook examples and package.json references

#### Validation Documentation
- ✅ **docs/TYPE_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md**: Updated pre-commit hook setup instructions

#### ACTIONS_MANIFEST.yml
- ✅ Added new pre-commit and footprint actions:
  - `precommit:unified`
  - `footprint:evolving`
  - `footprint:validate`

### 5. Current Pre-commit Workflow

The unified pre-commit system (`bun run precommit:unified`) now performs:

1. **Evolving Footprint Updates** (`bun run footprint:evolving --update true`)
2. **TypeScript Type Checking** (`bun run tsc --noEmit`)
3. **Schema and Pattern Validation** (`bun run validate:pre-commit`)
4. **Optional LLM Insight Generation** (`bun run scripts/precommit-llm-insight.ts`)
5. **Commit Message Validation** (`bun run scripts/commit-message-validator.ts --pre-commit --strict`)

### 6. Husky Pre-commit Hook

The `.husky/pre-commit` hook remains unchanged and continues to use the comprehensive validation system that includes:

- Timestamp filter checks
- TypeScript type checking
- Type and schema cohesion validation
- Linting
- Test suite execution
- Pre-commit validation
- Enhanced commit message validation
- Fossil/plan validation
- Performance monitoring

## Benefits of the Cleanup

### 1. **Simplified Maintenance**
- Single source of truth for pre-commit logic
- Reduced script duplication
- Clearer validation flow

### 2. **Better Documentation**
- Comprehensive pre-commit workflow documentation
- Clear troubleshooting guides
- Updated examples throughout

### 3. **Consistent Experience**
- Unified validation approach
- Consistent error handling
- Standardized output format

### 4. **Improved Traceability**
- All validation steps clearly documented
- Clear success/failure indicators
- Optional steps properly marked

## Migration Notes

### For Contributors
- Use `bun run precommit:unified` for all pre-commit validation
- Legacy scripts have been removed
- All documentation has been updated

### For CI/CD
- No changes needed - existing hooks continue to work
- Validation coverage remains comprehensive
- Performance monitoring still active

### For Development
- Manual testing: `bun run precommit:unified`
- Individual steps can still be run separately
- All validation tools remain available

## Verification

To verify the cleanup was successful:

```bash
# Test the unified pre-commit workflow
bun run precommit:unified

# Verify legacy scripts are removed
ls scripts/pre-commit-*.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "Legacy scripts removed successfully"

# Check package.json for removed scripts
grep -E "footprint:pre-commit|footprint:evolving:pre-commit" package.json || echo "Legacy scripts removed from package.json"
```

## Conclusion

The pre-commit system has been successfully unified and all documentation has been updated to reflect the current state. The cleanup removes legacy complexity while maintaining comprehensive validation coverage. All contributors should now use the unified approach for consistent and reliable pre-commit validation.
